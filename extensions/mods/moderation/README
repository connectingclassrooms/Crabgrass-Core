== Moderation 

This crabgrass mod allow for god-like moderators of all users
and groups in a particular site. 

== Usage

edit config/routes.rb (this should be done for you already)

  map.from_plugin :moderation  rescue NameError

Specify which crabgrass group will have super admin power in crabgrass.*.yml:

  sites:
    - name: <<site1_name>>
      admin_group: <<admin_group_name1>>
      moderation_group: <<moderation_group_name1>>
    - name: <<site2_name>>
      admin_group: <<admin_group_name2>>
      moderation_group: <<moderation_group_name2>>

If you want the moderation capability of moderation, add the migration to crabgrass:

  % script/generate plugin_migration
  % rake db:migrate

You will also need to enable the super_admin mod, see mods/super_admin/README

restart rails and browse to: http://localhost:3000/admin

== Migration Issues

If running migrations for this plugin throws an error, it is likely that the plugin_schema_info table record for this plugin is out of sync with the actual state of the database.  To fix:

look at the moderation migrations (located in mods/moderation/db/migrate) and try to figure out what migration number matches what your current mysql tables look like. then, insert that version number in the plugin_schema_info table. so if the table structure matched what was in migration 003 but not 004 then the following sql query should be run:
replace into plugin_shema_info (plugin_name, version) values ('moderation', 3);
